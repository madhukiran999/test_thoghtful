Volume Calculation: First, it calculates the volume (width * height * length).
Bulky Check: It determines if the package is bulky by checking if the volume exceeds or equals 1,000,000 cm³ or any dimension is 150 cm or more.
Heavy Check: It checks if the mass is 20 kg or more to consider the package heavy.
Dispatch Logic:
If the package is both heavy and bulky, it’s dispatched to the REJECTED stack.
If it’s either heavy or bulky, it goes to the SPECIAL stack.
Otherwise, it’s a STANDARD package.
